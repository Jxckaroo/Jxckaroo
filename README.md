## About Me

Hi! :wave:

I am Jack, a **backend developer** primarily focused on **PHP** & **C#**.

Most of my work on here is on-going background projects which don't get updated much, as they are done in free time as & when. My main project at the moment is getting my start-up going, [Animoria Ltd](https://animoria.com).

You can checkout most of my updated work on my website [Javeloper](https://javeloper.co.uk).
